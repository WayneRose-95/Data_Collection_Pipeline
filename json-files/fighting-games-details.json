You blew through some of the fiercest opponents; taking down AJ Styles, devastating Robert Roode, and destroying Booker T. But then... everything changed. The politics behind the ring got heated, and not in your favor. When you finally claimed the title, someone came for you. And now you're here. You've woken up in what appears to be a rundown hospital in Mexico, and you can't remember a thing; your name, what you do, and certainly not why you're here. Lost in a land that is not your own, you need to get back to America. You hear talk of a local wrestling match where the winner goes on to wrestle at a nearby American Air Force base. This is the best shot you've got at getting home. But once you're in the ring, something strange happens. Your body seems to remember what your mind cannot. Punches, grapples, throws, and stomps all come naturally, as if you were a seasoned professional...This is where your journey begins. Find your way home, remember who you were, and claim what was rightfully yours. [SouthPeak Games]"

        "description": "Capcom's popular and critically acclaimed ‘VS’ fighting series is getting an all new next-generation introduction. Tatsunoko vs. Capcom pits Capcom’s iconic characters against Tatsunoko Productions anime superheroes. This clash of heroes face off in two-on-two battles for the ultimate 2D tag-team battle. Originally released in Japanese arcades in the Fall of 2008, the original Tatsunoko vs. Capcom moved to the Wii console on December 11, 2008. This fighter blends these two rich universes by taking Capcom characters like Ryu from Street Fighter, Morrigan from Darkstalkers and the giant PTX-40A from Lost Planet and putting them against Tatsunoko fan-favorite characters from Gatchaman, Hurricane Polymar, Casshern and more. It’s a battler oyale that delivers match-ups that only exist in fans wildest dreams! Unlike the more well-known six-button layout that the Street Fighter franchise pioneered, the VS line features a simplified four button system: Weak, Medium, Strong and Assist for the tag-team option of. The Assist feature adds another compelling element found Capcom’s other VS series: allowing players to switch their character on the fly or call for help from their tag-team partner, allowing for spectacular super moves (Hyper Variable Combination). Successful execution of the Assist feature can turn the tide of battle on a dime. Historically the VS series excels in integrating the tag-team options by including customized moves like Variable Assist, Snapback, and the previously mentioned Hyper Variable combination that lets both characters on one team perform their Hyper attack. TvC enhances the above gameplay with new mechanics, including the Variable Aerial Rave that allows characters to be switched in the middle of an Aerial rave. More moves include the offensive Assault and defensive maneuver Mega Crash. Another new gameplay mechanic, titled Baroque, illuminates the character in a rainbow of colors, cancels the current attack and extends combos and damage. Featuring a robust line-up of characters, the console version added four mini-games and optional control schemes. [Capcom]"

However, you'll quickly learn that it takes more than pluck and optimism to earn victory in the coliseum. With the help of a spirited mechanic named Venus, you'll have to take on a series of jobs to earn the money and fame required to make a name for yourself about town as a skilled Trotmobile operator. When a series of bandit attacks begins to affect the city's economy and distress the citizens, who will have the mettle and the metal to put a stop to it? You control your adventure -- Mission-based gameplay puts you in the driver's seat: you choose what you do and say. Take on missions ranging from cross-town delivery to mining in a canyon to defeating bandits. The money and fame points earned can be used to upgrade your Trotmobile and enter arena battles. Complete freedom to build -- The cardinal rule of Trotmobile design is that there is no ideal design. Instead, there are tons of customization options, letting you upgrade your arms, legs, heads, bodies, and more, each changing the nature of how you battle! Personalize your vehicle with color and emblem to make it distinctively yours. Four-player competition mode -- Clash with your friends' Trotmobiles in 4 player ad hoc multiplayer! Set each player against the others battle royale style, or pair up for tag team action. One cartridge, four players -- Only one UMD disc? You can still compete!

The new “Dragon Missions” in Dragon Ball Z: Infinite World include many famous scenes from the Dragon Ball Z series never before seen in a video game. A range of missions from time attack in the “Snake Road Mission” alongside other action and racing-style missions puts players’ strategy and quick-thinking skills to the test beyond simply showing off their deadly fighting skills. But no Dragon Ball Z game would be complete without its fair share of spectacular battles. Dragon Ball Z: Infinite World uses a simplified battle system taken from the recently released next-gen Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit for thrilling hand-to-hand fighting on the ground, or flying leaps and aerial combat in the skies. Defeat your opponent by blasting damaging Ki attacks from the sky or by diving into him and launching an explosive smash attack. The game features over 40 unique characters, not counting the various character transformations which multiply the playing potential. On top of characters, fighting techniques and battle stages, Dragon Ball Z: Infinite World also includes selected drama scenes from the previous games all presented using beautifully refined effects and shading techniques.

Each sign has its own temple, and each temple has its own guardian. The evil Zodiac Master is trying to attain the powers of the twelve guardians as that will make him virtually unstoppable. One thing stands in his way: the Golden Dragon. When the Chinese martial arts student, Ang, is chosen over his twin sister Ling to be the next Golden Dragon destined to fight the Zodiac Master, Ling joins the dark side in a quest for redemption. In the battle between good and evil both heroes and villains have magic wristbands that can transform them into mythical warriors, giving them the precise likeness and superhuman powers of the zodiac creature they represent. Each of the 18 playable characters has a unique fighting technique and, therefore, must be played differently. Characters transform themselves into magical warriors using their wristbands. When transformed they perform different types of magic and cast spells based on their Chinese astrological sign. 4 challenging single-player modes: Quest, Arcade, Survival and Time. 3 exciting multiplayer-modes: Versus, Team Battle and Tag.

The complete DBZ mythology, from Dragon Ball To Dragon Ball GT. Post customizable character codes to the Internet. [Atari]"
