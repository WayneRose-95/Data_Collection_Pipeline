> The goal of the project is to create a scalable data-pipeline, which runs autonomously within a cloud environment.

## Milestone 1 - Choosing a Website 

For this project, the website: [metacritic.com](https://www.metacritic.com) was chosen. 

As an avid fighting game player, I wanted to create a dataset by scraping all of the fighting games from the website. 

This would create an opportunity to compare and contrast the various fighting games on the website via certain metrics. 


Each of the pages has the following metrics to compare and contrast: 
* Title
* Platform (i.e. PS2, Xbox, PS3 etc.) 
* Release Date 
* MetaCritic_Score
* User_Score 
* Developer
* Description

## Milestone 2

- Does what you have built in this milestone connect to the previous one? If so explain how. What technologies are used? Why have you used them? Have you run any commands in the terminal? If so insert them using backticks (To get syntax highlighting for code snippets add the language after the first backticks).

- Example below:

```bash
/bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181
```

- The above command is used to check whether the topic has been created successfully, once confirmed the API script is edited to send data to the created kafka topic. The docker container has an attached volume which allows editing of files to persist on the container. The result of this is below:

```python
"""Insert your code here"""
```

> Insert screenshot of what you have built working.

## Milestone n

- Continue this process for every milestone, making sure to display clear understanding of each task and the concepts behind them as well as understanding of the technologies used.

- Also don't forget to include code snippets and screenshots of the system you are building, it gives proof as well as it being an easy way to evidence your experience!

## Conclusions

- Maybe write a conclusion to the project, what you understood about it and also how you would improve it or take it further. -->
